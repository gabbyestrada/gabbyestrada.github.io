        <p>
          I am currently a sophmore in a P-Tech school in Newburgh, New York
          called the Excelsior Academy.

          <p>
           P-tech stands for Pathways
          in Technology Early College High School, which allows
          students to take college courses along with their
          regular high school class. Right now I am taking College
          Prep but in the second semester the Computer
          Science course will start.
          <p>
          However, last year and this year my classmates continue
          to learn about computers and tecnology.

            <ul>
              <b><u>Coding Languages I Know</u></b>
                <li> HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
              </ul>
            After I follow my path I will
            graduate with my High School Diploma and an
            Associates degree in Applied Science in Cyber Security
            or Computer Information Technology.
