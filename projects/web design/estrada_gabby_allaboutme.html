<b> My family wasn't always that big. Being that my older sister moved out long ago,
I was the only child. However, now we're living with my sisters two youngest kids.
I love being an Aunt, my neice and nephew are the most important people in the world
for me. I really feel that I have a bigger responsibility being that they live with us
to be a good Aunt and to be big sister to them as well. My nephew's name
is Divine and he is 5 years old,
My niece's name is Miah and she is only 3.

I was born and am being raised in Newburgh, New york.
Newburgh is famous for all the history that took place here in the past,
including the beautiful architecture. Today Newburgh <i>is</i> known, but not for
such great things. It's actually quite sad to see my hometown in the rut that
it's in, however Newburgh does have some little things that are completely overlooked
way too often. In my opinion, we have the best veiws of the the Hudson River in all
of New York. Especially by the waterfront, which happened to be my favorite place to
visit when I was small. The street art here is also overlooked so often that I'm actually a bit
suprised. There are colorful murals in some little parts of Newburgh that I just find
completely beautiful.

My education is something I've always took seriously and honestly something cherish.
I know that I have to work hard <i>now</i> in order to avoid a major struggle in the future.
I have high standards for myself and try to push myself to do better and be bigger to
the point where it can be annoying to others, but it's actually just my way of self-improvement.
My elementary school was G.A.M.S. and I went to Heritage for middle school. I was taught same, basic,
common core as every other student. That was until I joined Excelsior, although I never had any past
knowledge with computers I knew that I would be taught the skills I needed and saw it as a major
oppurtunity!

  <ul> <b>
  <li> I love art - all art, any art - new or old! One of my favorite artist is Vincent van Gogh.
       He's really old and it may sound cliche that I like him but I think it's mostly
       just his story and the fact that he kept painting despite what everyone in his time thought
       of him. </li>

<p>
  <li> I love to show off my creativity. There are some things that I refuse to show the light of day
       to, but when I do want to, I could just sit and draw for hours if you let me.
       I practice my skills all the time with small doodles and sketches. </li>
<p>
  <li> I also like making collages. I starting doing this when I couldn't find posters that were as
       diverse as my interests. So I decided to print, cut and glue a bunch of pictures together.
       They're hanging all over my room and even on my binders, an I have to admit they're pretty cool
       looking ^ - ^   </li>
<p>
  <li> My favorite music artist are The Neighbourhood, Ed Sheeran, Ariana Grande,
       an many, many more!  </li>
