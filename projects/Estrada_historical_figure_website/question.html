	Albert Einstein will probably always be recognized as one of the greatest scientists of the 1900s. He’s quite possibly the greatest in all of history. His theories and philosophies of the world changed the perspectives of many intelligent beings. The cause of his success is often said to be his constant flow of curiosity and many of the things that inspired him would evoke wonder from him starting at a young age. According to Biography.com, “One was an encounter with a compass at age five, where he marveled at the invisible forces that turned the needle.”(Biography 1) many of his young childhood fascinations is what caused much of his success as he aged. 
	Albert’s most prestigious accomplishment has to be the set of scientific papers that were published in 1905. According to an article written by Samuel Glasstone;
In the first of these papers, on Brownian motion, he made significant predictions about the motion of particles that are randomly distributed in a fluid…
The second paper, on the photoelectric effect, contained a revolutionary hypothesis concerning the nature of light…
Einstein's third major paper in 1905, ‘On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies’, contained what became known as the special theory of relativity. (Glassstone 1)
All the subjects discussed on each of the papers furthered the understanding of concepts such as light, time, space, energy and gravity. ( Pakhare 1) However, it wasn’t the theory of relativity that won him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1922. According to Sarah Laskow, “he received it primarily for his explanation of the photoelectric effect.” ( Laskow 1) Einstein also helped with the development of the first atomic bomb. During this time, World War II was in action and according to Markus Pössel , “Einstein wrote a letter to president Roosevelt, explaining about the potential power of nuclear weapons and the possibility of Nazi Germany developing such weapons, and urging the president to take action.” Thus began the Manhattan Project where Einstein’s theory of relativity was placed into direct action. (Pössel 1) 
	Without Albert Einstein's contributions the cognizance of physics, technology and many other complicated aspects of science would be backed up greatly. He helped others understand what light really is and proved the existence of molecules. (Pakhare 1)  The theory of relativity was used to study and advance nuclear energy. Einstein even warned the U.S. of what Germany was planning and quite possibly saved a few lives by doing so. Einstein really pushed the world to understand the things around them and had many thought provoking revelations.
