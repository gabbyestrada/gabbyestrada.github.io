The infamous Albert Einstein was a very intelligent man and had a great impact on American history. He was also a very important factor to the development of science, mathematics and technology through his well known theories of relativity. Einstein had many accomplishments and furthered the understanding and thought  on the  complicated elements of physics and science. Justification for this is the fact, alone, that today we use his name as a literal synonym for ‘genius.’ Einstein has created many scientific papers and won many awards, one of which is a Nobel Prize in Physics proving just how much he benefited the world. ( Küpper 1)
	Albert Einstein was born on March 14 in 1879. He was born into a Jewish family in Ulm, Germany. He grew up with his father, Hermann Einstein, his Mother, Pauline Koch, and his younger sister, Maja Einstein. (shmoop. 1) As a child Einstein wasn’t considered very bright. According to an article by J.C. Evans, "there was even some concern on the part of his parents when he was a small child that he might be somewhat backward." this being despite the fact that he studied math and science on his own free time. (Evans 1) Einstein even dropped out of high school in 1896, however, according to Evans, "in 1896 he was able to enroll at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich after making up a number of subject deficiencies." (Evans 1) According to Biography.com, Albert Einstein's big break wasn’t until 1905, the article states, “In 1905—often called Einstein's ‘miracle year’—he submitted a paper for his doctorate and had four papers published in the ‘Annalen der 
Physik’, one of the best known physics journals.”  (Biography 1) These papers are where Einstein began to develop his theory of relativity, E=mc2, 	which was not fully completed until 1915. Einstein became a U.S. citizen in 1935 after the rise in power of german nazi began to target him, being that he is jewish. A passage by Cecil Ramnaraine from mincava.edu states, "Einstein was proscribed and his property seized in Berlin. Thus he could live there no longer." (Ramnaraine 1) Once settled, he took a job at Princeton University and lived there until his death on April 15th 1955.
	Despite the deficiencies and setbacks he had as a child Albert Einstein tirelessly self-educated himself. This led him to make giant changes to the world of math and science. Einstein’s theories and scientific papers helped make many advancements. He earned many accolades and is still recognized to this day, inspiring others to bring change. He made it to be a major influence on the technological world and made to be vital part of  American history.
