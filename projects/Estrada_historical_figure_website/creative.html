Dear Mr. Talmud,<p>   
<center><image src="http://www.martinezwritings.com/m/Kinematics6_files/ZIM00007667.jpg" width="230px" height="270px"><p></center>                                                                                                        
	During some recent reflection I have come to remember the factors that has lead me to the success in which I hold. You, Mr. Talmud, being one of them. Firstly, allow me to reintroduce myself. My name is Albert Einstein and I am currently housed in Princeton, New Jersey in the United States of America, where I have been recently named a citizen.(Muhammad 1) 
 I am a Jewish man and was born in Ulm, Germany and raised by my parents Herman and Pauline Einstein, whom I presume you remember. (Muhammad 1) 
	If memory serves me correctly, your full name is Max Talmud, an empty pocketed student of medicine.(Hoormann 1) My brother brought you over every week to join us for dinner. (Hoormann 1) This is where you introduced me to those books that evoked such curiosity. Many books on science, philosophy and math were given to me by you. (Hoormann 1)  This sparked such a flame for my interest in those particular fields.
	I  excelled in school in math and science, though teachers told me to drop out due to lack in the other subjects. (Robbins 1) However, I continued to put all my effort into the development  of science. I have no intentions of bragging, but I have achieved some extraordinary endeavors in my time. In 1905, I wrote a series of scientific papers in which I explained complicated things such as light, molecular atoms, and the the theory of relativity.(American Institute of Physics 1) Being completed in 1915 my theory soon became famous, contributing to many wonders of the scientific world. (American Institute of Physics 1)
	Again, Mr. Talmud, I am writing to inform you that your gifts to me as a child is one of the curiosity invoking entities that lead me to ask questions, to then find the answers for. Sir, you are a contribution to the development of science and to my prosperity in what I am passionate of most. I want to thank you greatly for that.
<p>

Sincerly,
   Albert Einstein, an old family friend.
