<h2>
<b> 
My education is something I've always took seriously and honestly something cherish.
I know that I have to work hard <i>now</i> in order to avoid a major struggle in the future.
I have high standards for myself and try to push myself to do better and be bigger to 
the point where it can be annoying to others, but it's actually just my way of self-improvement.
My elementary school was G.A.M.S. and I went to Heritage for middle school. I was taught same, basic,
common core as every other student. That was until I joined Excelsior, although I never had any past 
knowledge with computers I knew that I would be taught the skills I needed and saw it as a major
oppurtunity!
