<b> My family wasn't always that big. Being that my older sister moved out long ago, 
I was the only child. However, now we're living with my sisters two youngest kids.
I love being an Aunt, my neice and nephew are the most important people in the world 
for me. I really feel that I have a bigger responsibility being that they live with us 
to be a good Aunt and to be big sister to them as well. My nephew's name
is Divine and he is 5 years old,
My niece's name is Miah and she is only 3.

I was born and am being raised in Newburgh, New york.
Newburgh is famous for all the history that took place here in the past, 
including the beautiful architecture. Today Newburgh <i>is</i> known, but not for
such great things. It's actually quite sad to see my hometown in the rut that 
it's in, however Newburgh does have some little things that are completely overlooked
way too often. In my opinion, we have the best veiws of the the Hudson River in all
of New York. Especially by the waterfront, which happened to be my favorite place to
visit when I was small. The street art here is also overlooked so often that I'm actually a bit
suprised. There are colorful murals in some little parts of Newburgh that I just find
completely beautiful.
