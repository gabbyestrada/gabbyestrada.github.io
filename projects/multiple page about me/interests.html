  <ul> <b>
  <li> I love art - all art, any art - new or old! One of my favorite artist is Vincent van Gogh. 
       He's really old and it may sound cliche that I like him but I think it's mostly
       just his story and the fact that he kept painting despite what everyone in his time thought
       of him. </li>

<p>
  <li> I love to show off my creativity. There are some things that I refuse to show the light of day
       to, but when I do want to, I could just sit and draw for hours if you let me.
       I practice my skills all the time with small doodles and sketches. </li>
<p>
  <li> I also like making collages. I starting doing this when I couldn't find posters that were as
       diverse as my interests. So I decided to print, cut and glue a bunch of pictures together.
       They're hanging all over my room and even on my binders, an I have to admit they're pretty cool
       looking ^ - ^   </li>
<p>
  <li> My favorite music artist are The Neighbourhood, 5 Seconds of Summer, Ed Sheeran, Ariana Grande,
       an many, many more!  </li>
